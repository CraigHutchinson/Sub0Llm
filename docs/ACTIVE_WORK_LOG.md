# Active work log — cross-agent coordination

This repo now has more than one agent working on it concurrently (at minimum: Claude Code on the
Qwen4-preview/WP4 track, and a separate independent-review agent working through
`docs/INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_BACKLOG.md`'s items). Two failure modes this file exists to prevent:

1. **Two agents editing the same file at the same time** — not just a merge conflict, but one agent's
   in-flight investigation silently invalidated by the other's concurrent change to a shared surface
   (`backend_cpu.cpp`, `layout.hpp`, `gdn_math.hpp`, etc. are read/written by nearly every work package).
2. **CPU-contended perf/build work running alongside another agent's perf-sensitive work** — a heavy
   `cmake --build`, test suite run, or benchmark on one track can add real noise to timing measurements
   on another track (this project's own established lesson,
   `[[thermal-confounds-ab-wallclock-testing]]` — interleave trials, don't contend). This applies even
   when the two tracks touch disjoint files.

**Protocol, deliberately lightweight** — a table row, not a lock file:

- **Before starting work that touches a shared file**, check the table below for an overlapping "Files/
  areas" entry with `status: active`. If one exists, either pick different work or coordinate directly
  (leave a note in this file, or ask the user).
- **Before running a CPU-heavy build, full test suite, or benchmark**, check whether another row is
  `status: active` with a perf-sensitive workload (training, Muon optimizer work, CPU profiling). If so,
  ask before running — don't just proceed and hope the numbers are still trustworthy.
- **When you start a work package that will touch files for more than a few minutes**, add a row.
  **When you finish (merge, abandon, or hand off)**, update its status rather than leaving it stale.
- Status values: `active` (currently being worked, files below are hot), `paused` (started, not
  currently running — safe to touch but coordinate if resuming), `done` (merged/complete, historical).

## Log

| Started | Agent | Work package | Branch | Files/areas | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-07 | Claude Code | WP4f: root-cause the layer-0 Sub0Llm-vs-llama.cpp divergence | `fix/wp4f-layer0-divergence` (tentative — not yet confirmed pushed) | `include/sub0/transplant.hpp`, likely `include/sub0/gdn_math.hpp`/`gated_residual_math.hpp`, `tools/sub0llm-transplant.cpp` | active | Dispatched to a background subagent; hit a rate limit mid-fix ("now the core fix in `transplant.hpp`"). See memory `wp4-handover-2026-09-07` for full context and resume instructions. |
| (backlog) | Independent review agent | B14: finish Muon scratch reuse + profile matrix products | — | `include/sub0/muon.hpp`, `src/backend_cpu.cpp` (Muon step) | active | Per the user directly, in progress now. CPU-heavy/perf-sensitive — other agents should not run competing benchmarks concurrently. |

## Cleared for the independent-review agent to pick up next (after B14), per this file's own read of WP4's active scope

Cross-checked `docs/INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_BACKLOG.md`'s own "Suggested execution order" against WP4's
actual currently-hot files (`transplant.hpp`, `gdn_math.hpp`, `gated_residual_math.hpp`,
`sub0llm-transplant.cpp`, and — if the divergence investigation's root cause turns out to be on the
Sub0Llm side — potentially `backend_cpu.cpp`'s GDN/GR forward path). The backlog's own scheduling
already reasoned about this carefully and mostly agrees with the read below; noted where this adds
detail.

**Safe to start now, no file overlap with WP4's active work**:
- **B04** (harden `tokmap.hpp` corpus parsing) — isolated parser, no shared file.
- **B05** (reject truncated tokenizer semantics tables, `tokenizer.cpp`) — isolated; the backlog's own
  "coordinate with tokenizer work" caveat doesn't apply, nothing in WP4 touches the tokenizer.
- **B09** (build provenance / `SUB0_GIT_SHA`, `CMakeLists.txt`) — small, additive, `CMakeLists.txt`
  changes so far in WP4 have been new `add_executable`/`target_*` blocks for new tools, not the
  provenance-capture logic B09 targets — low collision risk, but announce the specific lines touched
  before merging since `CMakeLists.txt` is a genuinely shared file.
- **B11** (verify `cmake/get_cpm.cmake` bootstrap) — fully independent.
- **B17** (`window.hpp` document-window fallback) — independent data-path work, no WP4 overlap.
- **B07/B08 design work** (test harness design, validation-gate design) — design-only per the backlog's
  own scope; fine to start, just don't wire it into `scripts/wp4b_check.sh` (already correctly excluded
  by the backlog itself) or any other currently-active WP4 script.
- **B18** (document process/thread-ownership contract) — **mostly safe as pure documentation**, but
  `core.hpp` now carries WP4f's `forward_capture` declaration (merged, stable, not actively changing) —
  fine to document around it; just don't add code/assertions to `core.hpp` itself without checking this
  log first, since a fresh WP4 stage could still add another entry point there.

**Wait until the current WP4f investigation resolves (its outcome determines whether `backend_cpu.cpp`'s
GDN/GR forward path or `gdn_math.hpp`/`gated_residual_math.hpp` need a real fix)**:
- **B12** (forward-only arena overhead in `backend_cpu.cpp`) — the backlog already correctly scheduled
  this as "wait for Claude's stable comparison baseline"; sharpened here: specifically wait for the
  layer-0 divergence investigation above to resolve, since a real fix there may itself touch
  `backend_cpu.cpp`'s per-layer forward path.
- **B15** (CPU affinity / gradient-reduction) — same file, same reasoning; the backlog already says "do
  not run competing CPU benchmarks alongside Claude's performance runs," which also means: not while
  the divergence investigation's own (likely CPU-heavy) verification work is active.
- **B06** (validate before committing loaded state, `engine_core.cpp`) — the backlog already scheduled
  this for "after Claude's checkpoint"; `engine_core.cpp` also carries WP4's `model_file.hpp`
  extraction and `forward_capture` wiring (both merged/stable), so this is safe once the current active
  branch above resolves, same as the backlog's own read.
- **B01/B02/B03/B13/B16** — the backlog's own scheduling for these already looks sound from WP4's side;
  no additional WP4-specific conflict found, so defer to the backlog document's own ordering.

**This section should be re-checked, not assumed stale-safe** — re-read this file's own Log table above
before actually starting any of the "safe now" items, in case a new WP4 row has appeared since this was
written.
